I developed a comprehensive "Doctor Appointment System" as my semester project for the Web Engineering course. The system incorporates the following features:

SignUp: Users can create accounts by providing necessary information.

SignIn: Registered users can log in securely to access personalized features.

Home: The main landing page offers a welcoming and intuitive interface.

About Us: A dedicated section providing detailed information about the platform and its purpose.

Services: Users can explore the range of services offered by the platform.

Contact Us: A contact page with relevant details for users to reach out for any queries or concerns.

Book Appointment: A crucial feature allowing users to schedule appointments with healthcare professionals efficiently.

Review: Users can share their feedback and experiences, contributing to the platform's credibility.

Additionally, the entire system is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices.

I have uploaded this project information to my GitHub account, providing a glimpse of the system's capabilities. Please feel free to explore the repository for further details.
